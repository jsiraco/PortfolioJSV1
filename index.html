                My name is Josef and I'm currently studying to be a web-developer. I'm working as both a tourism
                counselor for the Maine Tourism Association as well as a party rental deliveryman (I run a mechanical
                bull, deliver water slides, bounce house, etc.). My main hobbies are cooking, hiking, eating, and going
                to museum. I'm a lifelong student and enjoy learning of any kind. On this site you will find a listing
                of some of my professional projects that I will update as time goes on and some ways to contact me.
